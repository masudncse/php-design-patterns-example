## PHP Design Patterns

In PHP, some of the most commonly used design patterns include:

- Factory pattern: This design pattern provides a way to create objects in a super class, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- Singleton pattern: This design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- Prototype pattern: This design pattern allows new objects to be created by copying existing objects.

- Adapter pattern: This design pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. It wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the client's interface.

- Decorator pattern: This design pattern allows new functionality to be added to an existing object dynamically.

- Facade pattern: This design pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

- Command pattern: This design pattern allows you to encapsulate actions as objects, allowing you to parametrize clients with different operations.

- Observer pattern: This design pattern allows objects to be notified when the state of another object changes.

- Mediator pattern: This design pattern allows communication between objects to be mediated by a central object, rather than allowing objects to communicate directly with each other.

- MVC pattern: This design pattern separates the application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model represents the data, the view displays the data, and the controller handles the input.
